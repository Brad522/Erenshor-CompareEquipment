## [1.1.0] - 2025-04-18

### Added
- UI windows (Item Info and Compare) now dynamically adapt their position based on screen resolution and aspect ratio.
- Edge clamping added to prevent windows from rendering off-screen on any resolution.

### Fixed
- Previously, the windows only positioned correctly at 2560×1440 resolution. This update ensures consistent display across all screen sizes.
