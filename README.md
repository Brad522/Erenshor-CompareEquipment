# Erenshor-CompareEquipment
A mod for Erenshor that adds an Item Compare Window to the game in order to enhance equipment comparison. The Mod displays a side-by-side UI panel allowing you to compare an item you are currently viewing with the item you have equipped.

## Features

- Automatically displays the details of equippable items when hovered over.
- Dynamically displays a comparison window if you have an item equipped in the same slot as the item you are looking at requires.
- Switches comparison between Primary and Secondary slots when needed via key input (default: F).

## Requirements

## Usage

- Hover over an item that is equippable and it's details will automatically be shown.
